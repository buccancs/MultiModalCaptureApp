# Multi-Modal Recording System Integration Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to integrate and use the comprehensive multi-modal recording system with enhanced networking, synchronization, data management, and validation capabilities.

## System Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Enhanced Time Synchronization** (`pc_controller/core/time_sync.py`)
   - Robust NTP-like protocol for device clock alignment
   - Network failure recovery with exponential backoff
   - Multi-device coordination capabilities
   - Adaptive sync intervals based on quality

2. **Sync Events System** (`pc_controller/core/sync_events.py`)
   - Event broadcasting for data alignment verification
   - Heartbeat monitoring for connection health
   - Quality assessment and reporting

3. **Data Management Suite**
   - Session manifest generation with enhanced quality metrics
   - File aggregation with coordinated multi-device support
   - Data validation with comprehensive quality reporting
   - Export utilities for MATLAB, HDF5, NumPy, Parquet formats

4. **Testing and Validation**
   - Multi-device synchronization test suite
   - Calibration utilities with LED/audio/timestamp markers
   - System validation tools for production readiness

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize Core Components
```python
from core.device_manager import DeviceManager
from core.time_sync import TimeSynchronizer, MultiDeviceCoordinator
from data.session_manifest import SessionManifestGenerator

device_manager = DeviceManager()
time_sync = TimeSynchronizer()
coordinator = MultiDeviceCoordinator()
manifest_gen = SessionManifestGenerator()
```

### 2. Setup Multi-Device Session
```python
# Register devices
device_ids = ["device_1", "device_2", "device_3"]
for device_id in device_ids:
    time_sync.register_device(device_id)

# Create device group
coordinator.create_device_group("main_group", device_ids)

# Start session
session_id = manifest_gen.start_session("experiment_001")
```

### 3. Run Synchronization
```python
# Coordinate multi-device sync
results = await coordinator.coordinate_group_sync("main_group", time_sync)

# Verify sync quality
for device_id, success in results.items():
    quality = time_sync.get_sync_quality_level(device_id)
    print(f"Device {device_id}: {'Success' if success else 'Failed'}, Quality: {quality.value}")
```
