# Development Continuation Summary

## üéØ **Session Overview**
This session continued the development of the Multi-Modal Capture System by implementing a comprehensive multi-camera preview system and enhancing the user experience with polished interactions.

## üìã **Major Accomplishments**

### 1. **Multi-Camera Preview System Implementation** ‚úÖ
- **Created dedicated PreviewActivity** with support for 5 camera types:
  - Front Camera (Selfie)
  - Back Camera (Main)
  - Wide Angle Camera
  - Telephoto Camera
  - Thermal Camera (IR)

- **Implemented PreviewViewModel** with comprehensive camera management:
  - Camera system initialization and discovery
  - RGB and thermal camera switching
  - Real-time camera information updates
  - Availability detection for all camera types

- **Designed intuitive UI layout** with:
  - Camera selection buttons with visual feedback
  - Real-time preview containers for RGB and thermal
  - Camera information panel with resolution, FPS, and status
  - Professional Material Design styling

### 2. **Enhanced User Experience** ‚úÖ
- **Loading States**: Added "Switching camera..." indicators during transitions
- **Haptic Feedback**: Implemented vibration feedback for camera switching (with VIBRATE permission)
- **Smooth Animations**: Added fade-out/fade-in transitions between camera modes (200ms/300ms)
- **Button Management**: Disabled buttons during switching to prevent rapid clicks
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time status updates and button state changes

### 3. **System Architecture Improvements** ‚úÖ
- **Separation of Concerns**: 
  - MainActivity now focuses on sensor status display
  - PreviewActivity handles all camera preview functionality
- **Clean Navigation**: Seamless transition from main app to dedicated preview page
