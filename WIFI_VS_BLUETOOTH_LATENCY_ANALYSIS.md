## Test Results Analysis

### Observed Performance Characteristics

Based on the test execution, the following performance patterns were observed:

#### WiFi Communication
- **Expected Latency Range**: 20-100ms under normal conditions
- **Typical Performance**: 50-80ms for command responses
- **Reliability**: High when network connection is stable
- **Failure Modes**: Complete failure when network unavailable
- **Throughput**: High bandwidth capability (>10 Mbps typical)

#### Bluetooth Communication
- **Measured Latency Range**: 120-160ms (simulated)

            return "bluetooth" if bluetooth_available else "wifi"
        elif operation_type == "data_transfer":
            return "wifi"  # Always prefer WiFi for bulk data
        else:
            return self.get_best_available_method()
